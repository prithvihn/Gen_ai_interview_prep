# Python Programming interview questions

[1]  Is Python a compiled language or an interpreted language?
 - Python is an interpreted language. It is executed line by line, and the code is not compiled into machine code before execution. Instead, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code directly.
[2] How can you concatenate two lists in Python?
 - We can concatenante 2 strings using(+) operator.
````python
a=[1,2,3]
b=[4,5,6]
temp=a+b
print(temp)
````
OUTPUT:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

[3] What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
 - A list is mutable, meaning that you can change its contents after it has been created. A tuple, on the other hand, is immutable, meaning that once it has been created, its contents cannot be changed. Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses().

[4] Is Indentation Required in Python?
 - Yes, indentation is required in Python. It is used to define the scope of loops, functions, and other code blocks. Proper indentation is crucial for the correct execution of Python code, as it indicates which statements belong to which blocks.

[5] How are arguments passed by value or by reference in Python?
 - Python’s argument-passing model is neither **Pass by Value** nor **Pass by Reference** but it is **Pass by Object Reference**. 
 Depending on the type of object you pass in the function, the function behaves differently. Immutable objects show “pass by value” whereas mutable objects show “pass by reference”.
 ````python
 def call_by_val(x):
    x = x * 2
    return x


def call_by_ref(b):
    b.append("D")
    return b


a = ["E"]
num = 6

# Call functions
updated_num = call_by_val(num)
updated_list = call_by_ref(a)

# Print after function calls
print("Updated value after call_by_val:", updated_num)
print("Updated list after call_by_ref:", updated_list)
````
OUTPUT:
````
Updated value after call_by_val: 12
Updated list after call_by_ref: ['E', 'D']
````
