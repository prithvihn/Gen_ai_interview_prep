🔹 Python Functions – Interview Answers

1. What are first-class functions in Python?

In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they are treated like any other object (e.g., integers, strings).

This means:
They can be assigned to variables.
They can be passed as arguments to other functions.
They can be returned from other functions.
They can be stored in data structures like lists or dictionaries.

This feature enables advanced concepts like closures, decorators, and higher-order functions.

2. What is the difference between *args and **kwargs?

*args collects extra positional arguments and stores them in a tuple.
**kwargs collects extra keyword arguments and stores them in a dictionary.
They are used when we don’t know beforehand how many arguments will be passed to a function.

3. Explain positional-only, keyword-only, and default arguments.

Positional arguments must be passed in the correct order.
Keyword arguments are passed using parameter names.
Default arguments have predefined values if no argument is supplied.
Positional-only parameters (using /) must be passed positionally.
Keyword-only parameters (using *) must be passed by keyword.
Python binds arguments based on position first, then keywords.

4. What is the LEGB rule in Python?

LEGB defines how Python resolves variable names:
Local – Inside the current function
Enclosing – Inside outer (nested) functions
Global – At the module level
Built-in – Python’s predefined names

Python searches in this exact order when a variable is referenced.

5. What is the difference between global and nonlocal keywords?

global is used to modify a variable defined at the module (global) level.
nonlocal is used inside nested functions to modify a variable in the enclosing function.
nonlocal does not refer to global scope; it refers to the nearest enclosing scope.

6. What are closures in Python?

A closure occurs when:
A nested function remembers variables from its enclosing scope,
Even after the outer function has finished execution.

Conditions for closure:

There must be a nested function.
The inner function must reference a variable from the outer function.
The outer function must return the inner function.

Closures are commonly used in decorators and function factories.

7. What are decorators in Python?

A decorator is a function that modifies or extends the behavior of another function without modifying its actual code.

It works by:
Taking a function as input,
Wrapping it inside another function,
Returning the modified function.

Decorators are commonly used for:
Logging
Authentication
Timing functions
Access control

8. What is the difference between a lambda function and a normal function?
Lambda Function                                 	Normal Function
Anonymous	                                           Has a name
Single expression only	                               Multiple statements allowed
Defined using lambda	                               Defined using def

Lambda functions are best for short, simple operations.
They are not suitable for complex logic.

9. Can a function return multiple values?

Yes. Python allows returning multiple values separated by commas.
Internally, Python packs them into a tuple and returns that tuple.
This is called tuple packing and unpacking.

10. What happens when mutable objects are passed to a function?

Python uses pass-by-object-reference (also called pass-by-assignment).
If a mutable object (like a list or dictionary) is modified inside a function, the changes reflect outside.
If an immutable object (like int or string) is reassigned, it does not affect the original.
This is because Python passes references to objects, not copies.

🔹 Recursion – Interview Answers
11. What is recursion? How is it different from iteration?

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem.

Difference:
Recursion uses function calls and the call stack.
Iteration uses loops (for, while) and does not create new stack frames.

Recursion is preferred in:
Tree traversal
Divide-and-conquer algorithms
Backtracking problems

12. What are the essential components of a recursive function?

A recursive function must have:

Base Case – Stops recursion.
Recursive Case – Calls itself with smaller input.
Without a base case, recursion continues indefinitely and causes a RecursionError.

13. What is recursion depth and recursion limit?

Recursion depth is the number of active recursive calls on the call stack.
Python has a default recursion limit (around 1000) to prevent stack overflow.

It can be checked using:
sys.getrecursionlimit()

This limit exists to protect memory and avoid crashes.

14. What is tail recursion? Does Python optimize it?

Tail recursion occurs when the recursive call is the last operation in the function.
Some languages optimize tail recursion to reuse stack frames.
However, Python does NOT perform tail call optimization, meaning each recursive call still uses additional stack memory.

15. What are the advantages and disadvantages of recursion?

Advantages:

Cleaner and more readable for certain problems
Natural fit for recursive data structures (trees, graphs)
Easier implementation for divide-and-conquer

Disadvantages:

Higher memory usage (call stack)
Slower due to function call overhead
Risk of stack overflow
Harder to debug for deep recursion
