# Basic LLM Interview Questions

1. What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
- A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. LLMs can perform various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering.

2. How do LLMs work?
- LLMs work by using deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to process and generate language. They learn patterns and relationships in the training data, allowing them to predict the next word in a sentence or generate coherent text based on a given prompt.

3. What are some popular LLMs?
- Some popular LLMs include OpenAI's GPT series (GPT-3, GPT-4), Google's BERT, and Facebook's RoBERTa. These models have been widely used in various applications, such as chatbots, content creation, and language translation.

4. Explain the Transformer architecture.
- The Transformer architecture is a deep learning model that uses self-attention mechanisms to process input data. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder processes the input text and the decoder generates the output text. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and context effectively.

5. What is self-attention?
- Self-attention is a mechanism used in transformer models that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing it. It computes a weighted sum of the input tokens, where the weights are determined by the relevance of each token to the others. This helps the model capture relationships between words, regardless of their position in the sequence.

6. What is fine-tuning?
- Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM and further training it on a specific task or dataset. This allows the model to adapt its knowledge to perform better on the target task, such as sentiment analysis, question-answering, or language translation.

7. What is RLHF?
- RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. It is a technique used to improve the performance of LLMs by incorporating feedback from human evaluators. The model is trained to optimize its responses based on the feedback received, which helps it generate more accurate and relevant outputs.

# Practical / Applied LLM Questions

1. How would you reduce hallucinations?
- To reduce hallucinations in LLMs, you can implement techniques such as:
  - Using a more controlled generation process, like beam search or nucleus sampling, to limit the model's output to more likely sequences.
  - Incorporating external knowledge sources or databases to provide factual information during generation.
  - Fine-tuning the model on a specific domain or task to improve its accuracy and relevance.
  - Implementing post-processing steps to filter out irrelevant or incorrect outputs.

2. What is RAG?
- RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality of generated responses. In RAG, the model retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base or external source and uses that information to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

3.  How do you evaluate LLMs?
- LLMs can be evaluated using various metrics, depending on the task. Common evaluation metrics include:
  - Perplexity: Measures how well the model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.
  - BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): Used for evaluating machine translation by comparing generated text to reference translations.
  - ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): Used for evaluating summarization by comparing generated summaries to reference summaries.
  - Human evaluation: Involves human judges assessing the quality of the generated text based on criteria such as relevance, coherence, and fluency.

4. What are scaling laws?
- Scaling laws refer to the observed relationships between the size of a model (in terms of parameters), the amount of training data, and the performance of the model. As models are scaled up in size and trained on more data, they tend to perform better on various tasks. However, there are diminishing returns as models grow larger, and it is important to find a balance between model size, training data, and computational resources.

5. What is LoRA?
- LoRA stands for Low-Rank Adaptation. It is a technique used to fine-tune large language models efficiently by reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated during training. LoRA achieves this by decomposing the weight updates into low-rank matrices, allowing for faster training and reduced memory usage while still maintaining performance on the target task.

6. How would you design an LLM system in production?
- Designing an LLM system in production involves several steps:
  - Define the use case and requirements for the LLM system, such as the target audience, desired functionalities, and performance metrics.
  - Choose an appropriate LLM architecture and pre-trained model based on the use case and computational resources available.
  - Fine-tune the model on a relevant dataset to improve its performance on the specific task.
  - Implement a scalable infrastructure to host the model, such as cloud services or on-premises servers, ensuring low latency and high availability.
  - Develop an API or interface for users to interact with the LLM system, allowing for input and output processing.
  - Monitor the system's performance and user feedback to continuously improve the model and address any issues that arise.

# Prompt Engineering Questions

1. What is prompt engineering, and why is it crucial for working with LLMs?
- Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to elicit desired responses from LLMs. It is crucial for working with LLMs because the quality and structure of the prompt can significantly impact the model's output. Effective prompt engineering can help guide the model to generate more accurate, relevant, and coherent responses, while poor prompt design may lead to irrelevant or nonsensical outputs.

2. Can you provide examples of different prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) and explain when to use them?
- Zero-shot prompting: This technique involves providing a prompt without any examples, relying on the model's pre-trained knowledge to generate a response. It is useful when you want to test the model's general understanding of a task or when you have limited data for fine-tuning.
- Few-shot prompting: This technique involves providing a prompt with a few examples of the desired output. It is useful when you want to guide the model towards a specific format or style of response, especially when the task is complex or requires specific knowledge.
- Chain-of-thought prompting: This technique involves providing a prompt that encourages the model to generate a step-by-step reasoning process. It is useful for tasks that require logical reasoning or multi-step problem-solving, as it helps the model break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts.

3. How do you evaluate the effectiveness of a prompt?
- The effectiveness of a prompt can be evaluated using various methods, such as:
  - Quantitative metrics: Depending on the task, you can use metrics like accuracy, BLEU, ROUGE, or perplexity to assess the quality of the model's output in response to the prompt.
  - Human evaluation: Involving human judges to assess the relevance, coherence, and fluency of the generated responses based on the prompt.
  - A/B testing: Comparing different prompts by deploying them in a production environment and measuring user engagement or satisfaction with the generated responses.

4. What are some strategies for avoiding common pitfalls in prompt design (e.g., leading questions, ambiguous instructions)?
- To avoid common pitfalls in prompt design, you can:
  - Use clear and concise language in the prompt to minimize ambiguity.
  - Avoid leading questions that may bias the model's response towards a specific answer.
  - Provide sufficient context in the prompt to help the model understand the task and generate relevant responses.
  - Test different prompt variations to identify which ones yield the best results and refine them based on feedback and evaluation metrics.

5. How do you approach iterative prompt refinement to improve LLM performance?
- Iterative prompt refinement involves a systematic process of testing and improving prompts based on the model's responses. You can start by designing an initial prompt and evaluating the output using quantitative metrics or human evaluation. Based on the results, you can identify areas for improvement, such as adding more context, rephrasing the prompt, or providing examples. This process is repeated until you achieve the desired performance from the LLM.

6. What tools or frameworks do you use to streamline the prompt engineering process?
- There are several tools and frameworks available to streamline the prompt engineering process, such as:
  - OpenAI's API: Provides a platform for testing and deploying prompts with various LLMs.
  - Hugging Face's Transformers library: Offers a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for fine-tuning and prompt engineering.
  - Prompt engineering platforms like PromptLayer or Promptable: These platforms provide interfaces for designing, testing, and managing prompts, allowing for easier iteration and optimization.
  - Custom scripts or notebooks: You can create your own scripts or Jupyter notebooks to experiment with different prompts and evaluate their performance systematically.

7. How do you handle challenges like hallucination or bias in LLM outputs through prompt engineering?
- To handle challenges like hallucination or bias in LLM outputs through prompt engineering, you can:
  - Design prompts that explicitly request factual information or evidence to reduce hallucinations.
  - Use prompts that encourage the model to consider multiple perspectives or provide balanced responses to mitigate bias.
  - Incorporate external knowledge sources or databases in the prompt to provide accurate information and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations.
  - Continuously evaluate and refine prompts based on feedback and performance metrics to address any issues related to hallucination or bias.

8. Can you explain the role of prompt templates and how they are used in prompt engineering?
- Prompt templates are pre-defined structures or formats for prompts that can be reused across different tasks or applications. They help standardize the way prompts are designed and can save time by providing a consistent framework for generating responses. Prompt templates can include placeholders for specific variables or instructions, allowing for easy customization while maintaining a consistent format. They are particularly useful in scenarios where similar types of prompts are needed, such as in chatbots or content generation, as they ensure that the prompts are well-structured and effective in eliciting the desired responses from LLMs.

9. How does the choice of a tokenizer impact prompt engineering and model performance?
- The choice of a tokenizer can significantly impact prompt engineering and model performance because it determines how the input text is processed and represented for the model. Different tokenizers may split text into tokens differently, which can affect how the model understands and generates responses. For example, some tokenizers may split words into subwords or characters, while others may use whole words as tokens. This can influence the model's ability to capture context and generate coherent responses. Additionally, the tokenizer's vocabulary size and handling of special tokens can also affect the model's performance, especially when dealing with out-of-vocabulary words or specific formatting requirements in prompts. Therefore, selecting an appropriate tokenizer that aligns with the model architecture and task requirements is crucial for effective prompt engineering and optimal model performance.

10. What is agentic prompting, and how does it differ from traditional prompt engineering?
- Agentic prompting is a technique that involves designing prompts to encourage the model to take on a specific role or persona, allowing it to generate responses that are more aligned with the desired behavior or style. This differs from traditional prompt engineering, which typically focuses on eliciting specific information or responses without necessarily guiding the model's overall behavior. Agentic prompting can be particularly useful in applications like chatbots or virtual assistants, where the model needs to maintain a consistent personality or tone while interacting with users. By using agentic prompts, you can create a more engaging and personalized experience for users while still ensuring that the model generates relevant and coherent responses.
