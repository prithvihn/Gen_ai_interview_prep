# Neural Networks & Backpropagation

## Interview Questions with answer
1. **What is a Neural Network?**
   - A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can learn to recognize patterns and make decisions based on input data.
2. **What is Backpropagation?**
   - Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training neural networks. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network and updating the weights to minimize the loss.
3. **What are the different types of activation functions used in Neural Networks?**
   - Common activation functions include:
     - Sigmoid: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \)
     - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \)
     - Tanh: \( f(x) = \tanh(x) \)
     - Softmax: Used for multi-class classification problems.   
4. **What is the difference between a feedforward neural network and a recurrent neural network?**
   - A feedforward neural network processes information in one direction, from input to output, without any cycles. A recurrent neural network (RNN) has connections that form cycles, allowing it to maintain a memory of previous inputs, making it suitable for sequential data.
5. **What is the vanishing gradient problem?**  
   - The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients of the loss function become very small during backpropagation, especially in deep networks. This can lead to slow learning or even the inability to update weights effectively, hindering the training process.   
6. **How can we address the vanishing gradient problem?**
   - Techniques to address the vanishing gradient problem include:
     - Using activation functions like ReLU that do not saturate.
     - Implementing batch normalization to stabilize the learning process.
     - Using architectures like LSTM or GRU for recurrent neural networks, which are designed to mitigate this issue.
7. **What is overfitting in neural networks, and how can it be prevented?**
   - Overfitting occurs when a neural network learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor generalization to new data. It can be prevented by:
     - Using regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization.
     - Implementing dropout, which randomly deactivates neurons during training.
     - Using early stopping to halt training when the validation loss starts to increase.
     - Increasing the amount of training data or using data augmentation techniques.
8. **What is the role of the loss function in training a neural network?**
   - The loss function quantifies the difference between the predicted output of the neural network and the actual target values. It serves as a measure of how well the model is performing, and the goal of training is to minimize this loss function through optimization techniques like gradient descent.
9. **What is the difference between batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent?**
   - Batch gradient descent computes the gradient of the loss function using the entire training dataset, which can be computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient using only a single training example at a time, which can lead to faster convergence but may introduce more noise in the updates. A compromise between the two is mini-batch gradient descent, which uses a small subset of the training data for each update.
10. **What are some common applications of neural networks?**
    - Neural networks are widely used in various applications, including:
      - Image and speech recognition
      - Natural language processing
      - Autonomous vehicles
      - Medical diagnosis
      - Financial forecasting
      - Game playing and reinforcement learning
11. **What is the difference between a shallow neural network and a deep neural network?**
    - A shallow neural network typically consists of one or two hidden layers, while a deep neural network has multiple hidden layers. Deep neural networks can learn more complex representations of data, but they also require more computational resources and are more prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.
